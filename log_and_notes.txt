1/16: Data cleaning R3. Adding values from columns together to create groups. 
Demogrpahics- Need new/different age groups
Econmetrics: Income by tax bracket? Other additon for certain columns tbd, need more insights
Education: Looks solid, do not think needs cleaning 
Households: Probably needs the most work. Might be useful to create a metadata.csv file to help gain insights

Could be useful for all datasets, will need to create a a function that has that and updates as I add new columns (this step could be a challenge)
